				<section>
					<p>A couple of months ago I made a first attempt to get <a href="http://www.asp.net/vnext">ASPNET.vNext</a> working on my Mac. It didn’t work out very well, and at the time I didn’t feel like putting a lot of effort in it, in particular because my experiments with <a href="https://github.com/continuoustests/OpenIDE">OpenIDE</a> gave me the impression that Mono on Mac was very unstable.</p>

<p>While I was running through some bookmarked posts in <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> this morning, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/">post</a> by Christian Weyer about getting vNext up and running on a Linux distrubution. He also had some issues to solve, which was not very encouraging, but as I’m slowly recovering from last night (<a href="http://www.mechelen.be/events/15082/2de-bierfestival-mechelen.html">beer tasting festival</a>, yummy :-)) in the couch, I thought that maybe now was a good time to make a new attempt. </p>

<p>And yes, I got things working this morning without much of a hassle. I just want to take some quick notes for future recap, because touching new things and then leaving them behind for a couple of weeks always forces me to relearn things over and over.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<ol>
  <li>kvm (k version manager)
    <ul>
      <li>With my previous attempt a while ago, I installed kvm as suggested in the docs, using Homebrew. As the docs indicate, it is a good idea to run <code>kvm upgrade</code> to make sure you have the latest version.</li>
      <li>Before I touched anything, <code>kvm list</code> showed that I had currently 3 versions installed. The default version was 1.0.0-alpha3.</li>
      <li>Running <code>kvm upgrade</code> did not install a more recent version. However, later on I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Home">Home repo</a> for vNext, which uses 1.0.0-alpha4 at the time of writing this, and I had to take some extra steps as I’ll explain soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>kpm (k package manager)
    <ul>
      <li>Running <code>kpm restore</code> will have the package manager read your <em>package.json</em> file, and resolve the dependencies of your application.</li>
      <li>I made the assumption that kpm would somehow invoke kvm to install a version that is not yet present on my machine (in <em>~/.kre/packages</em>), but apparently this is not the case, as shown further on when I talk about the samples.</li>
      <li>To find out where the repository for your dependencies can be found, kpm relies on the presence of a <em>Nuget.Config</em> file in the root of your application. At the time of writing, this is what the file looks like:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;packageSources&gt;
    &lt;add key="AspNetVNext" value="https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetmaster/api/v2" /&gt;
    &lt;add key="NuGet.org" value="https://nuget.org/api/v2/" /&gt;
  &lt;/packageSources&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="samples">Samples</h3>

<p>The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/home">here</a>. While running the console went smoothly, running the HelloMvc sample did not, indicating that the Hosting dll could not be found. To resolve this, I had to do a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>kpm restore</code> did not throw any errors, but the packages did not get restored either. Looking into <em>project.json</em> revealed a dependency on version 1.0.0-alpha4 of the framework, which was not installed on my machine when I checked.</li>
  <li><code>kvm install 1.0.0-alpha4-10353</code> fails, because it could not be found on the feed. Some research and I found that kvm.sh sets the KRE_FEED variable to the master branch if it has not been set. When I issued $KRE_FEED on my machine, it showed that the kvm configuration indeed pointed to <a href="https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetmaster/api/v2">the master branch</a>, while I actually needed the development branch. I updated the variable ( <code>KRE_FEED=https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext/api/v2</code>) and then trying again resolved this issue.</li>
  <li>When retrying <code>kpm restore</code>, packages still didn’t get restored. The final step I had to make, is issuing a <code>kvm use 1.0.0-alpha4-10353</code> to ensure that k uses the version that is expected by the application. Alternatively, while installing this version, a could have used a <code>-p</code> flag, indicating that I want the version to be the default one.</li>
</ol>
