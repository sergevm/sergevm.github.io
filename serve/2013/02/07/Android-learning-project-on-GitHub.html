				<h2 class="content">Android Learning Project On Github</h2>
				<section>
					<p>The last couple of years, I have been working on a little Android development learning project. Well, in the end it has become a considerable code base, because I always enjoy working on a realistic feature set, even in this kind of setting (learning, that is). I have pushed the code to GitHub this evening, as I don&#8217;t intend to work on it anymore (hey, I bought myself an iPhone a couple of months ago :-)). You find the unfinished code here.</p>

<p>The project has been quite a learning experience in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The last time I wrote some java code must have been more than 10 years ago. Java has evolved quite a bit since then, and e.g. the use of generics differs quite a bit from the generics I know and love in C#.</li>

<li>I used <a href='http://www.eclipse.org'>Eclipse</a> as an IDE for the first time. The last time I wrote some lines of code in java, I used <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Caf%C3%A9'>VisualCaf√©</a>. You need to learn to work with work spaces, manipulate build paths, etc.. Further more, over the nearly 2 years I occasionally worked on the project, the IDE as well as the <a href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html'>Android SDK</a><a href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html'>1</a> and other tools went through some revisions. If you look closely at the commits on the project, you will see that I struggled with these revisions quite a bit.</li>

<li>Of course, the <a href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html'>Android SDK</a> was totally new for me, and I had to learn the controls, the advised UI flows, localization etc. from the ground up. As often, Google was my friend in these learning days.</li>

<li>I learned a dependency injection framework (<a href='https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/'>Google Guice</a> and <a href='https://code.google.com/p/roboguice/'>Roboguice</a>). The latter helps a lot in setting up views, and really is a productivity booster. The links to the libraries are included in the readme on GitHub.</li>

<li>I learned <a href='http://junit.org'>JUnit</a> to write my tests. I used <a href='https://code.google.com/p/mockito/'>Mockito</a> for mocking purposes. I didn&#8217;t really get into using the Android SDK support for UI tests, and sticked purely to &#8220;domain&#8221; tests. It was the testing bit that led to experimentation with a DI framework in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot to introduce the functionality of the application.</p>

<p>The app is a stereotypical todo list manager (oh no, not another one), that works with a local database (<a href='http://sqlite.org'>Sqlite</a>), and that offers synchronization with <a href='http://www.toodledo.com/'>Toodledo</a>. It integrates with the Android OS using the alarms infrastructure in order to display reminders (e.g., remind me once, or remind me every 2 hours). Periodic tasks can be defined (e.g. &#8220;Send invoice&#8221;, each 1th of the month).</p>

<p>When you read the code, bear in mind that this is an informal learning project. Because of this, and as the code base has become quite large, there are - without a doubt - several inconsistencies in the code. That&#8217;s okay for me, it was never intended to be production code. At some places, the code may feel a bit overcomplicated, and it probably is. Finally, I&#8217;m sure I did not always write idiomatic Java code.</p>
